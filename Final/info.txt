In Splay Tree we first insert a node, if it doesn't already exist, then splay it to the root. 
However, if already exists then we just move it to the root. And the total cost is calculated
accordingly.

In modified splay tree we have a data field count that increments when an already present node is searched.
If a node's count is higher than root's count than the tree gets splayed according to that node.
